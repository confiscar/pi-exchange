# Pi Exchange

This project will consist of software developed for the Rasberry Pi 3 model B. The purpose of the software is to create a low-latency interface to an exchange simulation, that can place orders and try to execute the order as quickly as it can when there is a match. 

Getting Started

Server
------
#### 	Compile: gcc tcp_server.c exchange.c orderBook.c order.c -o server
#### 	Run: ./server
#### 	Connect to server using ip and port 8890
*note: the ip depends on whether server run local or remote, local: 127.0.0.1, remote: find the ip of device where server runs on*
	
#### 	Place order with 5 paramter divided by as single character ",". Sequence of parameters are as below:
1. single character p
2. b stands for buy, s stands for sell
3. price
4. amount
5. order id (generated by client)
*e.g. p,b,1.1,10,0*

#### 	Cancel order with 4 paramter divided by as single character ",". Sequence of parameters are as below:
1. single character c
2. b stands for buy, s stands for sell
3. price
4. exchange id (generated by server)
*e.g. c,b,1.1,1*

#### 	Response from server
1. status of current order <br>
------------------<br>|order ID: %d<br>|exchange ID: %d<br>|price: %f<br>|amount: %d<br>|status: %d<br>------------------
2. status of previous order <br>
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>~user ID: %d<br>~order ID: %d<br>~exchange ID: %d<br>~price: %f<br>~amount: %d<br>~status: %d<br>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
3. best price <br>
i. sell price: %f <br>
ii. buy price: %f <br>

#### 	Note:
-  to try the function of server, simple complie client.c with command "gcc client.c -o client" and run with command "./client 127.0.0.1" and type parameters as described above with enter
-  current version of server only works well with 1 client, so please test with 1 client
