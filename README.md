# Pi Exchange 

This project is software developed for the Raspberry Pi 3 model B to try and emulate a low-latency exchange simulation that can handle a large quantity of buy/sell transactions.

Getting Started
------
Both **Python** 3, **C **(*has to be run on raspberry pi / Linux*) and **Java 10** compilers will be needed to run each individual part.

***Linux***: 

**Run** the **install.sh script** to install the dependencies for the project, mainly a few libraries for python and Java 10 JDK. 

Then **run the run.sh script** to run all the bits of the project together. Take into account that the **setup** of the **ports and IP configurations** will have to be done manually for now. 

***Windows***: 

A PowerShell script is currently in the works, but it shouldn't be to hard to install the python dependencies using `pip install feedparser` and `pip install psutil`. 

Then just compile and run the bot, server and GUI. Take into account that you have to edit the port numbers and IP configurations manually.

Server
------
#### 	Compile: gcc tcp_server.c exchange.c orderBook.c order.c -o server
#### 	Run: ./server
#### 	Connect to server using ip and port 8890
*Note: the IP depends on whether server is running locally or remotely. For local: 127.0.0.1, remote: find the IP of device where server runs on*
	

#### 	Place an order with 5 parameters divided by the single character ",". 

#### 	The sequence of parameters are shown below:

1. single character p (place)

2. b stands for buy, s stands for sell

3. price

4. amount

5. order id (generated by client)

  

  **e.g. p,b,1.1,10,0***

#### 	Cancel order with 4 paramter divided by as single character ",". Sequence of parameters are as below:
1. single character c (cancel)

2. b stands for buy, s stands for sell

3. price

4. exchange id (generated by server)

  

  ***e.g. c,b,1.1,1***

#### 	Response from server

1. Status of current order

	* order ID: %d
  
	* exchange ID: %d
  
	* price: %f
  
	* amount: %d
  
	* status: %d

2. Status of previous order

	* user ID: %d

	* order ID : %d 

	* exchange ID: %d

	* price : %f 

	* amount: %d 

	* status: %d 

3. Best price

	* Sell price : %f

	* Buy price: %f

   
#### 	Note:
-  to try the function of server, simple complie client.c with command "gcc client.c -o client" and run with command "./client 127.0.0.1" and type parameters as described above with enter
-  current version of server only works well with 1 client, so please test with 1 client
